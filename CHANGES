After planning to only add small fixes to 0.98, some changes turned out to be larger than expected, and rather than half-solve
something I knew was already taken care of in the larger rewrite, I've pulled over a lot of the code from that rewrite, and will
probably discard the remains, making this the master branch again, at some point soon.

BREAKING CHANGES: Weathermap now makes use of PHP 5.6 features, so that is now the minimum version supported. No
more PHP 4 support. Sorry to CentOS 4 users! PHP 5.3 was an option, but that's also been end-of-life for several years now,
and makes using current development tools (like phpunit) more difficult.

1.0.0
    Special thanks to Rutger, arjanoosting, YATV and hawson for code contributions on github, and especially
    Martin (malgoe) for working on Vagrant and documentation to enable other contributors, and netniV
    for development support.

    CHANGE - Various performance improvements (thanks to ikorzha758 for lots of feedback back in 2014)
             For my test case, I got from 2.5 seconds to 0.6 seconds to render a set of maps - 5x speedup!
    CHANGE - Replaced entire configuration parser (part of performance changes)
    CHANGE - dsstats data plugin can skip looking up additional Cacti data by setting dsstats_no_cacti_extras
    CHANGE - rrdtool data plugin can skip looking up additional Cacti data by setting rrdtool_no_cacti_extras
    CHANGE - Moved all database access to use PDO, to avoid PHP 7.0 issues.
    CHANGE - LOTS of internal changes mostly pulled over from refactoring project:
             * New Target, ConfigReader, Colour and Scale classes
             * New Manager class handles all database access for Cacti plugin
             * Data picker is rewritten
             * Rewritten drawing code for links and nodes
             * Everything uses PHP namespaces now, and standards for format, naming and layout.
    CHANGE - Internationalization support - first translations are by me with Google Translate, so corrections are welcome!
    CHANGE - Totally rewritten editor. I know it looks the same, but the guts is entirely new.
    CHANGE - Lots more testing. New editor can be automatically tested. Lots of tests for rest of code.
    FIXED - PHP 5.3 bug introduced in command-line tool in 0.98
    FIXED - RRDtool 1.5 blank line issue
    FIXED - external-script datasource cleans up line endings properly
    ADDED - SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 datasource plugins
    ADDED - Ability to take SNMP settings from Cacti devices
    ADDED - Nodes can have named offsets defined with DEFINEOFFSET. Those names can be used in the NODES command for links
            and also for positioning other nodes. Defined offsets are inherited in templates. Think of switch ports on a switch image.
    ADDED - Cacti 1.x support. Many thanks to cigamit for the initial big commit on this!

IMPORTANT NOTE for 0.98 and later - you may need to reset permissions on your users after upgrading, as I've
finally switched to the "new-style" plugin API that's been around for 5+ years. This handles
permissions differently, unfortunately.

0.98 May 29 2016

    ADDED - New permission in Cacti: edit maps. Maps can be edited by authorized users without needing to enable the editor in the source code.

0.97c had no additional changes - it's just 0.97b with some silly errors fixed, and  all
the CSS files included with the correct paths. There were also reports of problems with the
actual zip file.  April 10th 2013

0.97b is a special release starting from 0.97a and backporting all the quick bugfixes from the 0.98 code.
There are larger structural changes in 0.98 and new features, but these bugfixes were useful enough to
warrant a new 0.97 release (especially the mysql schema change). A real 0.98 release will follow in
due course.

Also late addition to 0.97b - a couple of security analysts have pointed out flaws in the editor.
First, the ability to remotely create .php files and then cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities. Both
are really facets of the same thing - lack of input validation. 0.97b improves this a great deal.

Thanks to Gerry Eisenhaur and Daniel Ricardo dos Santos respectively for their security bug reports.

0.95	March 3rd 2008

        KNOWN ISSUE - ININFOURL/OUTINFOURL, INOVERLIBGRAPH/OUTOVERLIBGRAPH are not handled well by the editor. If you edit a map that uses these,

	ADDED - filenames for output are much less guessable now (may break external references to maps)
	ADDED - You can use 'DUPLEX half' on a link to make the bandwidth percentage
	        calculate work for half-duplex links
	ADDED - ININFOURL/OUTINFOURL, INOVERLIBGRAPH/OUTOVERLIBGRAPH, INNOTES/OUTNOTES
	        allow you to have different urls for the in and out side of links (based on idea from llow)
	ADDED - OVERLIBGRAPH (and IN/OUT versions) can take multiple URLs separated by spaces (again from idea by llow)

	FIXED - weathermap-cacti-rebuild.php to flat-out fail if Cacti environment is wrong.
	FIXED - SNMP DS plugin had a typo that stopped it working at all (and no-one
                noticed for almost a year :-) ). (thanks to Fratissier Christophe for pointing it out)
	FIXED - Added some better controls into SNMP DS plugin. You can correctly pull
                interface oper/admin status, for example, now.

        ADDED - Editor - Align horizontal and Align-vertical for links. Calculates link offsets to make link vertical/horizontal.
	CHANGE - Finally a better tab image, and a red 'active' one too, for the Cacti plugin.
	FIXED - "Full Screen Maps" mode in Cacti Plugin was broken by me adding the "View Only First" mode.
	FIXED - Imagemaps for horiz/vert format legend were wrong in editor (thanks to Alex Moura for pointing this out)
	FIXED - Changes for compatibility with Cacti 0.8.7's moved config file.

       FIXED - weathermap.conf really *is* a simple map again. My test version went out with 0.9 and 0.91
       INTERNAL added a lot more memory debug points in
       INTERNAL refactored the curve/link drawing code to make some new features possible/easier
       Further tweaks and improvements to check.php (Basic GD check, memory_limit check, PEAR Getopt check, and more explanation now)
       Small improvements to the editor's font-picking, including samples of all fonts.
       Added - Editor handles VIAs in a MUCH better way when moving nodes.
       Improved clipping reporting, improved plugin loading (Niels Baggesen)
       Added - BWSTYLE lets you choose between regular and angled bwlabels
               angled bwlabels follow the angle of the link arrow, which can save space.
       Added - Editor can pick Cacti graphs for NODE's overlib/infourl (but NOT targets)
       Added - COMMENTPOS allows you to move the position of comments along the link (like BWLABELPOS)
       FIXED - strange edge case with gradient SCALE caused div-by-zero (Tiago Giorgetti)
       CHANGE - The editor doesn't *require* an editor-config.php anymore. It *will* warn you if the defaults aren't enough, however.

0.91 - May 13th 2007
       FIXED RRD bug with '-' DS names. This was fixed in 0.9pre3, but somehow slipped through.
       FIXED KILO bug again (Steve Woodcock)
       FIXED handling of MRTG html files on remote systems
       FIXED ReadConfig doesn't complain about KEYPOS DEFAULT -1 -1 (as written by WriteConfig) anymore
       FIXED NOTES was not fully tested, and broke cactihost: targets, at least.
       FIXED BWLABELPOS wasn't handled properly by the editor/WriteConfig (it would swap the positions over)
	FIXED Documentation fixes for installation (to include check.php) and NODE TARGETs.
       NEW check.php checks for presence of possibly-missing functions in your PHP installation
       NEW 'quiet' logging setting for Cacti plugin - in LOW logging, only errors are logged.
       NEW add a - to the front of a targetspec and you can take away values instead of aggregating them (think Total-VPN=Internet, for example)
       NEW the scale line that was 'hit' for each link direction is stored in inscalekey and outscalekey

0.9  -    April 20th 2007

Changed node rendering - now we render to a transparent mini-image and blit them on. This will be good for the editor.
	FIXED long-undetected bug in HTML_ImageMap for similarly named nodes or links (SLander)
	   Added BWLABELPOS - you can specify the position of the bandwidth labels along the link
       Added OVERLIBCAPTION based on code from Jared Gillis
	   Moved all ReadData code into plugins to allow for user-supplied data sources
	   FIXED unreported bug where WriteConfig throws away floating point part of SCALEs
	  FIXED another variation of the imagemap sorting bug from 0.81 (Erik van Cutsem)
	FIXED KILO ignored bug (found/patch by Steve Woodcock)
	   FIXED unreported bug where WriteConfig throws away HTMLOUTPUTFILE and IMAGEOUTPUTFILE
	   Added facility to use multiple SCALEs in a map. SCALE takes an optional name. NODEs and LINKs can have a USESCALE line.
	   FIXED bugs relating to assumption that 'admin' user always exists, and that users never go away, in the Cacti mgmt tab (adrian marsh)
	   Logging is tidied up a bit under Cacti's poller
	   FIXED Added a warning for RRD data sources where the DS names you specify don't exist in the RRD file
	   Added numeric offsets for NODES lines, like for LABELOFFSET. Move the end of a link whereever you like.
	   Added a new 'static' datasource - you can hardcode values, if you ever needed to.
	   Added a 'gauge:' datasource to the rrd plugin. Allows you to use values from any rrd without bit/byte-conversion.
	   Added formatting tokens into most strings - you can print data on the map from various places, including stuff
	      placed there by plugins.
	   Added - if you specify an output filename ending in .jpg or .gif, you'll get a GIF or JPEG file.
	   Added - BACKGROUND and ICON also understand JPEG, GIF and PNG, if your GD library understands them.
	   Added - support for non-standard polling periods in Cacti plugin. You can choose to only update every so often, or not at all (manually).
	   Added - manual 'recalculate now' button in Cacti plugin's management UI
	   Added - SET command to pass hints into plugins or weathermap core, per-node, per-link or globally.
	   Cleaned up config parser. Can be more fussy. More consistent though.
	   Added - CLI tool takes --define to define SET-style variables

0.82   May 17th 2006
       FIXED another variation on ReadFromRRD not detecting NaNs properly (hyland)
       FIXED SQL error which affects only some MySQL 5s (gundamx)
       FIXED some minor php errors in setup.php (cigamit)
       Changed the rrdtool period from now-400 to now-800 to avoid long-poller-cycle problems.
       Did some more /=>DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR changes - there weren't any problems, but it's a potential one.
       FIXED if you use the editor and your rrdtool is somewhere other than /usr/bin/rrdtool then you get an incorrect error about checking line 27 of the CLI tool.

0.81 - April 17th 2006
       Added a Weathermaps link to the Cacti 'Configuration' side-menu. Removed 'Manage Maps' link in Weathermap tab. (knobdy)
       File-picker in editor no longer masks on *.conf
	   FIXED sort-order bug for imagemaps (Fran Boon)
	   FIXED plugin shows same map twice if you have 'Anyone + users' (Fran Boon, again)
	   FIXED default bandwidth duplicated field in editor. (qjy2000_cn)
	   FIXED now allow TITLEPOS 0 0 (actually, y=0 is useless, but x=0 might be useful) (knobdy)
	   Editor still won't upload images, but it WILL let you pick from any PNG files in the images/
	     folder, and any images already mentioned in the map configuration file for ICON and BACKGROUND
		 lines. (everyone and their dog)
	   Similar change for DEFINEFONT. You still have to hand-edit to define the font, but after that, the
	     editor will let you pick it.
	   Changed the dependency tests to NOT give a warning about particular DLL names.
	   Added more dependency tests for specific functions.
	   Changes some debug messages to warning, so that they are visible in the logs even without DEBUG on.
	   FIXED minor (unreported) bug with sort order in Manage Maps
	   Changed most Cacti Plugin code to use Cacti's (logging) SQL functions. Hopefully this will help
	     with running down a couple of problems for Windows users.
	   More error reporting generally.
	   Fixed error when creating multiple links between nodes in the editor (fozzy)
	   Docs update - More FAQs and config reference improvements/amendments.
	   Added 'Cycle' mode to plugin - automatically cycle between your weathermaps.

0.8 -  March 30th 2006
       Added ability to have multiple targets for a LINK - aggregate your T1s
       Added ability to use half an RRD (use '-' as the DS name) - if you have 'in' in one RRD, and 'out' in another
       Added a tab-seperated file datasource for TARGET lines, so you can draw anything you can dump into a textfile.
       Added ability to specify which corner of a NODE each LINK-end goes to - handy for busy hub nodes
       Added support for FreeType & GD fonts
       Added VIA points - a link can go around corners, and they're nicely curved too.
       Added gradient SCALEs - specify two colours for a band to have colours interpolated.
       Added many more colour controls for map elements:
		For Links: OUTLINECOLOR r g b ( or OUTLINECOLOR none)
		For Link bandwidth labels: BWOUTLINECOLOR, BWBOXCOLOR, BWFONTCOLOR
		For Nodes: LABELBGCOLOR, LABELFONTCOLOR, LABELOUTLINECOLOR, LABELFONTSHADOWCOLOR
		For Map 'furniture': TIMECOLOR, TITLECOLOR, KEYBGCOLOR, KEYTEXTCOLOR, KEYOUTLINE
       Added Cacti plugin. View and Manage UI, plus poller integration. No editor (yet)
       Updated example config to use new 0.8 features
       Re-organised manual, and heavily re-written config reference.
       Fixed cacti-pick.php some more (all done now?)
       Added non-bandwidth bandwidth labels: BWLABELS unformatted
	   Many Thanks to James Lang, Niels Baggesen and the [php-weathermap] mailing list for feedback
        during the testing of this release.

0.71 - January 23rd 2006
       Fixed database code in cacti-pick.php
       Fixed up editor to handle blank maps better.
       Fixed a problem with cached images in editor.

0.7 -	 December 28th 2005
        Updated the manual and example map to reflect all these changes.
	Added config options for HTMLOUTPUTFILE and IMAGEOUTPUTFILE. The
        idea is to reduce the size of command-lines, and make the map files
        more self-contained. CLI options still take precedence.
      Includes new 'DHTML' editor for the first time. This is still very much
			  in testing - backup any map configs you edit with it first!
      Fixed DrawLegend() to not go below a minimum width (it used to use the
			  title length, but that can be too small now)
      Added BACKGROUNDCOLOR option: take an R G B like the SCALE lines (request
			  from kbriggs)
      Ripped out some of the 'live PHP' code to make DrawMap a bit simpler.
      Added a check for PNG support in CLI command.
      Added command-line error-checking (Niels is back again)
      Added a fix for Windows line-endings. Seems that PHP uses Unix-endings even on Win32
      Added LINK DEFAULT and NODE DEFAULT - set the defaults for (nearly) any
	parameter. This also means that most node-affecting and link-affecting
	parameters are now per-node and per-link.
      Added ARROWSTYLE option - there's 'classic' and 'compact' with neater arrowheads.
      Added LABELOFFSET option to change the relative position of the LABEL when an
        ICON is also used.
      Added OVERLIBWIDTH and OVERLIBHEIGHT to allow better OverLib output (Niels B, once more)
      Switched to using 24bit images internally. This should improve the handling of
        PNG transparency in ICONs.
      Improved number and content of error messages.

0.6 -  14 Sep 2005
      Renamed weathermap.php to just 'weathermap' to make it more
      obviously not a PHP page.
      Fixed up NODE name regexp (thanks Niels Baggesen)
      Added warning for non-existent NODES in LINK (thanks again Niels Baggesen)
      HTML fix for <map> in generated HTML (Niels once more)
      More HTML fixes to make us a bit more XHTML-like.
      You can have an ICON and a LABEL now. LABEL is centred over the
      NODE, for the moment. Also, there's a drop shadow effect, to make
      it easier to read the overlaid text.
      New config features: LINKFONT, NODEFONT and KEYFONT to control the
      fonts used for those things. It's a number from 1 to 5.
      Added BWLABELS NONE for no labels on links at all (request from Ueli Heuer)
      Moved responsibility for complete HTML page from the class to the CLI program - MakeHTML produces an HTML fragment now.
      Added ability to customise timestamp and legend text, by adding new text after the KEYPOS and TIMEPOS commands.

0.5a - 16 Jun 2005
       Fixed totally embarrassing problems with the DS-specification code.
       As far as I can figure I never did test it. Oh dear. Thanks to
       Jethro Binks for speedy patches.

0.5 - 16 Jun 2005
      Fixed asymmetric BANDWIDTH bug - thanks rpingar
      Fix to make rrdtool commandline work on Windows - also thanks to rpingar
      Added specification of RRD DS names in TARGET ( blah.rrd:ds0:ds1 - that's in then out)
      Fix for different C libraries returning something other than NaN for a NaN (thru rrd) - now we look for good data rather than bad data.
      Allow for decimals in BANDWIDTH specifications - 1.5M should work now
      Allow for decimals in SCALE specifications - mainly useful for very small values on big links
      Brought back sub-1.0 percentages, which got lost somewhere along the line
      Added in warning for >100% lines
      Added TIMEPOS option so *you* get to choose where the timestamp goes, mgb
      Fixed stupid bug in ReadRRDData - Weathermap should follow the data better now. Thanks to 'cl'

0.4 - 11 May 2005
      Changed all internals to deal in bits/sec instead of bytes
      Moved timestamp back up to the top-right corner.
      *BREAKAGE* Changed BANDWIDTH to use bits too
      Added support for K,M,G,T suffixes on bandwidth specs
      Added KILO config file option to redefine 1K=1000 or 1K=1024 (or anything actually)
      Added --sizedebug commandline option, to help with figuring out
        what you did wrong with the new BANDWIDTH format. Shows max
        bandwidth instead of the current bandwidth on all links.
      Included something a bit more like a manual.
      *BREAKAGE* Changed BWLABELS options to be bits/percent, since they *are* bits!
      LABEL regexp relaxed to allow spaces in labels
      HTMLSTYLE, BWLABELS regexps tightened up to detect more errors
      Added new example config in docs/ directory
      Moved editor.php out of the way to random-bits
      Included a copy of auto-overlib.pl, just cos it's handy

0.3 - Apr 22 2005
      ICON config directive for NODEs added - same effect as jas0420's perl code
      Fixed WriteConfig a little - TITLEs are written.
      OVERLIBGRAPH config is written for NODES.
      Fixed bug with OVERLIBGRAPH DHTML and NODEs
      Added --image-uri option back in from the perl version

0.2 - Apr 21 2005
      NODEs with no label aren't drawn but can still be an endpoint for a LINK.
      Small bugfixes from mgb
      Included the editor.php for people to see
      Code tidyup for weathermap.php

0.1 - Apr 21 2005
      Initial pre-release version
