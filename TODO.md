## TODO

~~MapScale should really be divided into MapScale and MapLegend.~~

~~Also, a MapScaleEntry class with the testing for ColourFromValue~~

PSR-0/PSR-1/PSR-2 Stuff:
- ~~namespaces (now we're in 5.3-land)~~
- ~~one class per file~~
- ~~use autoloader (now we're in 5.3-land)~~
- ~~use phpcs/phpcbf for conformance checking~~

make a (no map yet) thumbnail for UI (that is, an image the same size as the map thumbnails so layout doesn't go strange)

per-map debugging - needs UI to enable!

map scheduling - needs UI

consolidated map-properties page in UI? (variable settings, plus schedule, plus debug, plus runtime info, etc)

Rewrite Cacti integration and editor manual pages

KEYBG/KEYOUTLINE/KEYTEXTCOLOR per-scale

Winding order problem (I think) with sharp-angled vias - see conf_via3.conf

entries in weathermap_data are never expired

standalone version of the cacti map browser

thumb2 file - 48x48px thumb to show in map management screen.

Include note about timezone stuff in docs

improve usage_stats to cover things other than keywords

Some kind of shorthand for 'last non-relative node'? Then the sub chunks WOULD be generic

{node:this_link_a:name}

TAG + {node:tagged:name}

Cacti editor picker - if it's not traffic_in/traffic_out, let you pick the DSes

Editor picker - plugin-supplied picker listings - allow for Zabbix,Zenoss,Cricket,Groundwork,MRTG,Orion,Smokeping,WUG etc to supply useful picker info

Browse subdirs for images in editor: http://forums.cacti.net/about34831.html

Text Alignment in labels: http://forums.cacti.net/about35264.html

Some kind of special warning for if ALL the maps fail in a cycle. 

Also some sort of highlight to show that the map wasn't updated successfully last time it ran (permissions problems).

ProcessString for timepos string (+ some formatted date strings for use elsewhere?)
