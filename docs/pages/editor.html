 <h2 id = "editor">The Map Editor</h2> 

 <p class = "notebox"><b>Note:</b> This section is basically unaltered from 
 the v0.7 manual. The editor hasn't really changed since then, except to fix 
 some bugs, and work with the new config directives 
 - that is to say, it won't edit them, but nor will it remove/damage them. 
 It's still true to say that the editor is the easiest way to initially lay 
 out your map, and pick your <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGETs</a> if you use Cacti, but after that, some 
 hand-editing will help with cosmetics. 
 </p> 

 <p>New in version 0.7, there is a partially-complete interactive editor 
 included. In this release, it allows for visual layout of nodes and links, 
 modification of most parameters, and some integration with Cacti for picking 
 data-sources. 
 <strong>It is not integrated into Cacti's management pages, OR access 
 control.</strong> </p> 

 <p>To use the editor, you need to make a few extra considerations beyond 
 those needed by the command-line weathermap software, as detailed in the 
 <a href = "main.html#install_standaloneeditor">Installation Guide</a>. 
 </p> 

 <p> 
 Once you have all that taken care of, put a copy of one of your 
 configuration files into the configs directory you just created, and then go 
 to: <tt>http://www.your.web.server/cacti/php-weathermap/editor.php</tt> (or 
 whereever you put it). You should get a menu to either create a map, or open 
 the ones you just put in that directory. 
 </p> 

 <p> 
 Hopefully, the actual editor is fairly self-explanatory. 

 <ul> 
 <li>You can click on any existing node or link to get it's properties 
 and change them. </li><li>You can delete a node or link from the 
 properties box. For nodes, you can move them from the properties box 
 too. </li><li>You can move the key or timestamp by clicking on them, 
 also. </li><li>If you set up the Cacti-related options in the 
 editor-config.php file, then you should also see an additional option to 
 pick a data source directly from Cacti, in the Link Properties 
 box.</li><li> To create a new node, choose the 'Add Node' button at the 
 top and then click on the map where you want the node to be.</li><li> To 
 create a new link, choose the 'Add Link' button then click on the two 
 nodes to link together, in turn. There are separate buttons at the top 
 for changing various global parameters. </li> 

 <li>There is no save 
 - Every change is written back to the configuration file immediately. 
 Make a backup copy if you feel the need to.</li> 
 </ul> 
 </p> 

 <p> 
 There are a number of things <i>not</i> editable in the editor currently: 

 <ul> 
 <li>background images and icons 
 - it's intended that the editor will allow you to upload image files to 
 the server, which will then appear in a list where appropriate.</li> 

 <li>colours 
 - there's no way to pick colours currently, either for the map elements 
 or for the scale.</li> 

 <li>defaults 
 - the editor lags behind the current command-line software here. It 
 generates 'old-style' global options for some features where the correct 
 thing to do is make changes to the DEFAULT link and node definitions. 
 Similarly, there is no per-node or per-link adjustment of things like 
 font, label style or label offset.</li> 

 <li><a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> TARGETs</li> 

 <li>Multiple SCALEs</li> 

 <li>Curves</li> 

 <li>Link offsets or Label offsets</li> 
 </ul> 

 Luckily, the editor shouldn't damage any of these things that you put into 
 the configuration file by hand, so it's safe to do some work in the editor 
 where it's quicker or more intuitive, and then fine-tune the file by hand.
