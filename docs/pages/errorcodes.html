 <h3>Error Code Reference</h3> 

 <p>This page is mainly here so that Google can find it, but here's a 
 complete list of all the error codes that Weathermap can produce, and what 
 each one means. </p> 

 <p>I added this after I noticed a lot of google searches for error messages, 
 that were not hitting a useful page in the manual. This page should be the 
 useful page. </p> 

 <dl class = "errorcodes"> 
 <dt id="WMWARN01">[WMWARN01]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Skipping drawing very short link (<em>linkname</em>). Impossible 
 to draw! Try changing <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_WIDTH">WIDTH</a> or <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_ARROWSTYLE">ARROWSTYLE?</a> " </p> 

 <p>Weathermap draws the arrowheads on links in proportion to the width 
 of the link. If your link is fat, then the arrowhead will be bigger. If 
 you have a very short link (nodes close together), you can get a 
 situation where there is not enough room to draw the 
 arrowheads. </p><p>If you reduce the width of the link, using <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_WIDTH">WIDTH</a> then 
 you might be able to make the arrowheads small enough so that they fit. 
 You can also use <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_ARROWSTYLE">ARROWSTYLE</a> to choose a smaller style of arrowhead 
 - <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_ARROWSTYLE">ARROWSTYLE</a> 1 1 is the smallest. </p> 

 <p>The most common cause of this error is that you have accidentally 
 placed two nodes on top of each other. In that case, move one of the 
 nodes. </p> 

 <p>In previous versions (0.8 to 0.82), this would result in the infamous 
 "FELL THROUGH Howie's crappy binary search is wrong after all" error 
 message. The solution is the same 
 - move the nodes, or change the link width </p>

 <dd><p>"Angled text doesn't work with non-FreeType fonts " </p> 

 <p>The standard fonts used by Weathermap are the ones bundled with the 
 GD graphics library. These fonts (number 1-5 when you select fonts) can 
 only be drawn 'flat', and not at an angle. </p> 

 <p>If you are using link comments, or the 'angled' <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_BWSTYLE">BWSTYLE,</a> then 
 Weathermap needs to be able to drawn text at any angle. To do this, it 
 needs a Truetype font to be used for that part of the map (the bwlabel, 
 or comment), which is drawn using the FreeType library. </p> 

 <p>To do this, you need to find a Truetype font, put it in your 
 weathermap folder, and then define a new font in your map config file: 
 <code><a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_FONTDEFINE">FONTDEFINE</a> 100 Vera 9</code> </p> 

 <p>Then you can use that new font (no. 100) in <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_COMMENTFONT">COMMENTFONT</a> or <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_BWFONT">BWFONT</a> 
 lines. </p> 

 <p>You can find some TrueType fonts, and an example.conf that does this 
 in the docs/example folder. </p><p>The reason the default comment font is 
 not a TrueType font is that the FreeType library is an 
 <em>optional</em> part of the GD library, so I can't assume that it will 
 be available. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN03">[WMWARN03]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Using a non-existent special font (<em>fontnumber</em>) 
 - falling back to internal GD fonts " </p> 

 <p>If you use a font number that doesn't exist by default(e.g. larger 
 than 5), and you haven't got a valid <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_FONTDEFINE">FONTDEFINE</a> line, then you will get 
 this error. Weathermap will use font 5 instead of the font you asked 
 for. </p> 

 <p>Most common reason for this error is that the font file could not be 
 found, or could not be loaded. Check the log for another error (WMWARN30 
 or WMWARN31). </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN05">[WMWARN05]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"ProcessString: <em>key</em> refers to unknown item " </p> 

 <p>You used a 'Special Token' string, like {node:this:something}, but 
 the 'something' you used isn't defined for the node or link you 
 specified. This is usually a typographical error. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN06">[WMWARN06]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Couldn't open <em>plugin-type</em> Plugin directory 
 (<em>dir</em>). Things will probably go wrong. " </p> 

 <p>Parts of Weathermap are loaded from plugins. If these plugin 
 directories don't exist, or are not readable due to file permissions, 
 then the plugins can't be loaded. All data-reading is done by plugins, 
 so without the data-source plugin directory, Weathermap won't do very 
 much. </p> 

 <p>Check that lib/datasources, lib/pre and lib/post folders all exist 
 inside your Weathermap folder. Check that they (and their contents) are 
 readable by the user that Weathermap runs as (e.g. your Cacti poller 
 user). On a Unix system, the directories should also be 
 <em>executable</em> by that user, so that the contents of the directory 
 can be seen. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN07">[WMWARN07]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"ReadData: <em>type</em> <em>name</em>, target: 
 <em>targetstring</em> on config line 
 <em>linenumber</em> was recognised as a valid <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> by a plugin that is 
 unable to run (<em>pluginname</em>) " </p> 

 <p>When the datasource plugins are loaded, each one is given a chance to 
 check if everything it needs is available. If something is missing, that 
 plugin can decline to load. If you have a <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> line that is aimed at a 
 particular plugin, and that plugin declined to load, you will get this 
 message. </p> 

 <p>Examples of this type of problem would be: Using cactihost: <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGETs</a> 
 but with the command-line tool where cactihost: can't load, or using the 
 rrdtool DS from the command-line, without correctly setting a path to 
 rrdtool in the <tt>weathermap</tt> command-line tool. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN08">[WMWARN08]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"ReadData: <em>type</em> <em>name</em>, target: 
 <em>targetstring</em>[4] on config line 
 <em>linenumber</em> was not recognised as a valid <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> " </p> 

 <p>You have specified a <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> that 
 <em>none</em> of the datasource plugins recognised. This is usually a 
 typographical error. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN09">[WMWARN09]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"ColourFromPercent: Attempted to use non-existent scale: 
 <em>scalename</em> for <em>itemname</em> " </p> 

 <p>You have added a <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_USESCALE">USESCALE</a> line to a <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> or <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINK,</a> but the scale name 
 wasn't defined using <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SCALE">SCALE</a> lines first. Define the <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SCALE">SCALE,</a> or check your 
 spelling. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN10">[WMWARN10]</dt> 

 <dd><p><a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">"NODE</a> 
 <em>nodename</em> has a relative position to an unknown node! " </p> 

 <p>You have used the relative <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_POSITION">POSITION</a> for a <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE,</a> but you did it 
 relative to a node that doesn't exist. Probably you have a typographical 
 error/spelling error... </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN11">[WMWARN11]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"There are Circular dependencies in relative <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_POSITION">POSITION</a> lines for 
 <em>number</em> nodes. " </p> 

 <p>You are using relative <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_POSITION">POSITION</a> for nodes, but somewhere you have a 
 node that is relative to another node that is relative to the first one 
 again - a loop. None of the nodes in the loop can be positioned correctly. 
 Solution: make at least one node in the loop have a normal absolute 
 position. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN12">[WMWARN12]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Failed to write map image. No function existed for the image 
 format you requested. " </p> 

 <p>You specified a particular format to write the map image with 
 IMAGEFILE, but your php/GD installation doesn't have support for that 
 image format. </p> 

 <p>You'll need to either choose a different image format, or 
 recompile/reinstall your php, php-gd and GD libraries to support that 
 image format. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN13">[WMWARN13],<span id="WMWARN15">[WMWARN15]</span>,<span id="WMWARN16">[WMWARN16]</span></dt> 

 <dd><p>"Failed to overwrite existing image file 
 <em>filename</em> - permissions of existing file are wrong? " </p> 

 <p>Most likely when using the Cacti plugin. The files in the output/ 
 directory are owned by a different user from the one running weathermap, 
 and so it can't overwrite those files. </p> 

 <p>The most common way to get into this situation is by using the 
 "Recalculate Now" button in the Cacti plugin. This creates files that 
 are owned by the user that your webserver runs as. When the poller 
 process comes along a few minutes later, it can no longer write over 
 those files with the new data. Solution: make sure that the directory, 
 and it's contents are owned by the poller user (or 'cactiuser') and 
 don't use the 'Recalculate Now' button any more. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN14">[WMWARN14]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Failed to create image file 
 <em>filename</em> - permissions of output directory are wrong? " </p> 

 <p>Again, usually in Cacti plugin. </p> 

 <p>Weathermap is unable to create files in the directory that the output 
 file should go 
 - this is the plugins/weathermap/output/ directory if you are using the 
 Cacti plugin. Make sure that directory is owned/writable by the user 
 that runs your poller process. This is the same permissions that you 
 would have set on the rra/ directory when installing Cacti itself. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN17">[WMWARN17]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Skipping thumbnail creation, since we don't have the necessary 
 function. " </p> 

 <p>Your php/php-gd/GD library doesn't include the imagecopyresampled() 
 function, which is required to make the thumbnail images used in the 
 Cacti plugin. To get that function , 
 you'll need to update/recompile/reinstall your php, php-gd and GD 
 libraries. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN20">[WMWARN20]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"No image (gd) extension is loaded. This is required by 
 weathermap. " </p> 

 <p>All the graphics work in Weathermap is done using the gd PHP 
 extension. Your php installation doesn't have this extension, or it is 
 not enabled. </p> 

 <p>You'll need to install or enable that extension to use Weathermap. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN21">[WMWARN21]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Your GD php module doesn't support PNG format. " </p> 

 <p>You specified an <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_ICON">ICON</a> or <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</a> image in PNG format, and your 
 php-gd extension doesn't support PNG format images. </p> 

 <p>You'll need to either choose a different image format, or 
 recompile/reinstall your php, php-gd and GD libraries to support that 
 image format. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN22">[WMWARN22]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Your GD php module doesn't support truecolor. " </p> 

 <p>Weathermap requires that your GD library and php-gd extension support 
 24-bit colour (or "TrueColor"). To get that function , 
 you'll need to update/recompile/reinstall your php, php-gd and GD 
 libraries. Most likely, this is the result of an older version of GD. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN23">[WMWARN23]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Your GD php module doesn't support thumbnail creation 
 (imagecopyresampled). " </p> 

 <p>See <a href = "#WMWARN17">WMWARN17</a> </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN24">[WMWARN24]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Duplicate node name <em>nodename</em> at line 
 <em>linenumber</em> - only the last one defined is used. " </p> 

 <p>You have used the same name for two or more <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> lines in your 
 config. This is probably a typo or cut &amp; paste error. One of the two 
 <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODEs</a> will not show up in the map. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN25">[WMWARN25]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Duplicate link name <em>linkname</em> at line 
 <em>linenumber</em> - only the last one defined is used. " </p> 

 <p>You have used the same name for two or more <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINK</a> lines in your 
 config. This is probably a typo or cut &amp; paste error. One of the two 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINKs</a> will not show up in the map. </p>

 earlier <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINKs.</a> " </p> 

 <p>You should usually specify your DEFAULT <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINK</a> 
 <em>before</em> all your 'real' <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINKs.</a> The reason is that when a new 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINK</a> is defined, it copies whatever the default settings are at that 
 point in reading down the config file, so you will end up with 
 inconsistent results. </p> 

 </dd> 

 <dt id="WMWARN27">[WMWARN27]</dt> 

 <dd><p><a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">"NODE</a> DEFAULT is not the first <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE.</a> Defaults will not apply to 
 earlier <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODEs.</a> " </p> 

 <p>You should usually specify your DEFAULT <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> 
 <em>before</em> all your 'real' <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODEs.</a> The reason is that when a new 
 <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> is defined, it copies whatever the default settings are at that

 <dt id="WMWARN28">[WMWARN28]</dt> 

 <dd><p>"Dropping <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINK</a> <em>linkname</em> - it hasn't got 2 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_NODES">NODES!</a> " </p> 

 <p>You defined a link where one or both of the nodes in the <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_NODES">NODES</a> line 
 don't exist. </p> 

 <p>Or you forgot to add a <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_NODES">NODES</a> line altogether. </p> 

 <p>A link goes between two nodes, so you need to tell weathermap which 
 two nodes, and they need to exist. </p>

 <p>To draw a link correctly with arrows, requires a certain distance between nodes. If your nodes are too close together, Weathermap will just skip drawing the link. This distance depends on the width of 
 the link (because the arrows are in proportion to the width). Try reducing the <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_WIDTH">WIDTH</a> of the link, changing to <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_ARROWSTYLE">ARROWSTYLE</a> compact, or moving the nodes further apart. </p>

 <p> 
 This tells you that for a given <em>map item</em> defined on that line of that config file, there is no data. Weathermap 
 has figured out which datasource plugin should be used, but that plugin was unable to get data for this target. It could 
 be a NaN in an rrd file, a non-existent file for several data sources, or a network timeout for some others. Usually the 
 plugin will also log some detail just before this, but you might need to turn on DEBUG loggging to see that.

 <p>PHP has a hard memory limit, to stop runaway scripts from killing 
 your server. Depending on the version of PHP, this can be quite low (8M 
 in older versions). Weathermap uses a lot (relatively) of memory to 
 produce the large image files. If it hits the PHP memory limit, then PHP 
 just kills the script with no warning. Because it can't log that it is dead 
 (because it is dead), it logs just before the 'risk' happens. 
 <em>If this log message is 
 <strong>not</strong> the last message in your log file, then 
 <strong>nothing is wrong</strong>!</em> </p> 

 <p>You can disable some messages like this one by changing settings in 
 Cacti. Go to Settings..Misc and set Weathermap Logging to 'Quiet'. If 
 you suddenly get a mystery where Weathermap is only updating some maps, 
 turn it back to 'Chatty' to see what is happening. </p>

 <p>The poller_output support works by looking in the Cacti database for 
 a filename that matches your <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> line. However, Cacti stores the 
 filenames relative to the rra/ directory. Weathermap tries to convert 
 your filename to that format, so it can find it in the database, but it 
 sometimes gets it wrong. The &lt;path_rra&gt; is the path that it is
