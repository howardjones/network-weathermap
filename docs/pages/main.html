                </div>

                <h2 id = "introduction">Introduction</h2><p>PHP Weathermap is one of
                <a href = "#alternatives">many</a> implementations of the same basic idea
                - take data from your network devices and use it to provide a
                single-page overview of the current state of network, like the one to
                the right. It complements a tool like
                <a href = "http://www.mrtg.org">MRTG</a>,
                <a href = "http://cricket.sourceforge.net/">Cricket</a> or
                <a href = "http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti</a>,
                that provide in-depth graphing, and historical information, and can use
                data from those systems to produce it's maps. In fact, it
                <i>requires</i> some other data-collection source, as it does no
                device-polling on it's own.</p>

                <p>This particular version is written in PHP, and it can read statistics
                data from MRTG-produced HTML files, plain tab-seperated text files and
                from RRD files, such as those produced by newer MRTG setups, Cacti (my
                favourite) or another tool. It can also generate HTML 'holder' files for
                the map images, which can include popup overlays of historical data
                and links into your other monitoring/statistics system. It also has a
                interactive map editor, so you can largely avoid the text configuration
                files, if you prefer.</p>

                <p>To get a better idea of what is possible, see the
                <a href = "#example">example map</a> that comes with this manual.</p>

                <h3>Requirements</h3>

                <p>Based on lessons learned with the perl version, this one has a very
                restricted set of dependencies
				<ul>
                <li>you'll need a recentish PHP (&gt;4.3.0 I think) including the CLI
                version and the 'gd' extension with PNG, TrueColour and FreeType
                support</li><li>You will need command-line (<i>aka shell/ssh/telnet</i>) access
                to the server which will host the maps.</li>
				<li>You will need the PEAR PHP extension system - this comes with PHP when it's built from source, but it is sometimes a separate package
				if you install PHP from modules (e.g. php-pear on Debian/Ubuntu Linux).</li>
                <li>To read RRD files, you'll need the rrdtool command-line program. </li>
				</ul>

                Apart from the gd module, these requirements are the same as for
                Cacti, which is the most-tested partner stats system.

                <p>To use the Cacti plugin, you will need a recent version of Cacti, and
                possibly the matching Cacti Plugin Architecture, from
                <a href = "http://cactiusers.org/">Jimmy Conner's Cactiusers.org</a>. From Cacti 0.8.8 onwards,
				the Plugin Architecture is built-in.</p>

                <h2 id = "support">Support</h2>

                <p>There are two mailing lists for php-weathermap:

                <dl>
                    <dt>php-weathermap@thingy.com</dt>

                    <dd>General discussion of weathermap-related issues, bug reports and
                    development. Fairly low traffic currently. Typically contains
                    discussion of test or beta versions too, when they are
                    circulating.</dd>

                    <dt>php-weathermap-announce@thingy.com</dt>

                    <dd>Very low volume list for new version announcements and other
                    similarly rare events!</dd>
                </dl>

                More information about how to subscribe to the mailing lists is

                the website</a>.</p>

                <p>Also, if you have an RSS reader, you can subscribe to the

                for php-weathermap</a> which contains roughly the same content as the
                -announce mailing list.</p>

                <h2 id = "installation" >Installation
                Guide</h2>

                <p>How to install Weathermap depends on how you intend to use it:

                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "install-cacti-editor.html">As a Cacti Plugin, with
                    the web-based editor</a></li>

                    <li><a href = "install-cacti.html">As a Cacti Plugin</a></li>

                    <li><a href = "install-cli-editor.html">As a standalone command-line
                    tool, with the web-based editor</a></li>

                    <li><a href = "install-cli.html">As a standalone command-line
                    tool</a></li>
                </ul>
		
		<h3 id="#security">Security</h3>
		<p>Weathermap has several features that can potentially give users more access than you intended to. This section describes
		the risks, and possible ways to mitigate them.</p>
		<p>First of all, there are quite a few folders in the weathermap distribution that don't need to be web-accessible. If you aren't' using the
		Cacti plugin, then practically all of it can be blocked or moved elsewhere. If you are using Weathermap with Cacti, then you can still
		deny ALL access from web users for the configs, output, lib and random-bits directories. The distribution comes with .htaccess files that
		will do this for you if you have Apache, and you have enabled "AllowOverride All" for the Weathermap directory (it may be on by default -
		you can test by trying to access http://yourserver/cacti/plugins/weathermap/lib/ - you should get a 403 Forbidden error.</p>
		<p>Secondly, you should use additional access control (by IP or authentication) to limit who can access the editor.php and cacti-pick.php pages. The second of those
		will allow someone accessing the page to see a list of all the datasources in your Cacti installation. The first one allows
		anyone who can access it to edit your maps (logically enough). <em>However</em>, Weathermap includes a datasource plugin that
		allow someone who can change the TARGET lines in a map to potentially run any command as the Cacti poller user. As of version 0.97b, this plugin
		(<a href="targets.html#script">external</a>) is disabled by default.</p>
		
                <p>Any user with access to the editor can also see all your maps. In a shared or service provider environment, this may be
		a Bad Thing.</p>

                <h2 id = "running">Running Weathermap</h2>

                <p>There are two ways to run Weathermap.</p><p>If you are using the
                Cacti plugin, then it will be run for you as part of the Cacti poller
                cycle. You don't need to do anything special apart from add your map
                configuration files, as explained in the
                <a href = "cacti-plugin.html">Cacti plugin</a> notes.</p>

                <p>If you are using weathermap as a standalone tool, you do it using the
                command line version. See the
                <a href = "cli-reference.html">CLI Reference</a> for all possible
                options, but a good starting point is something like:</p>

                <div class = "shell">
                    <pre>php ./weathermap --config myconfigfile.conf --output mymap.png --htmloutput mymap.html</pre>
                </div>

                <p>You can skip the htmloutput and output parts if you have
                HTMLOUTPUTFILE and IMAGEOUTPUTFILE lines in your configuration file.</p>

                <p>Usually, people want to run weathermap regularly (it's not a
                requirement though!). To do that, you need to create a 'cron job' or
                'Task Scheduler Task' to run a command-line like the one above on a
                regular basis. You probably already have a similar task setup to collect
                the data that weathermap is reading. This is the same kind of thing.</p>

                <h2 id = "basics">Basics</h2>

                <p>The weathermap is defined by a plain-text file which by default is
                called weathermap.conf (you can have many configurations, and choose
                between them with command-line switches). By default, weathermap will
                read that file, and produce a single PNG file called weathermap.png.</p>

                <p>The configuration file has three sections: Node definitions, Link
                definitions and Global settings. There is an
                <a href = "#example">example of a complete file</a> at the bottom of
                this page.</p>

                <h3>Nodes</h3>

                <blockquote class = "example">
				<cite>A simple NODE</cite>
                    <pre>NODE nycore1
	LABEL NYC
	POSITION 30 30
</pre>
                </blockquote><p>Nodes are the points on your network that are joined together.
                Depending on the detail in the map, they might be cities or individual
                routers. In a basic map, a node has 3 pieces of information
                - an internal name which must be unique to this node, it's position from
                the top-left corner of the map, in pixels, and optionally a label, which
                will appear within the box marking the position of the node. Nodes
                without a label don't appear on the map at all, but can still be used as
                an endpoint for a link.</p>

                <h3>Links</h3>

                <blockquote class = "example">
				<cite>A simple LINK</cite>
                    <pre>LINK backbone1
	NODES nycore1 paix1
	BANDWIDTH 3M
	TARGET ../my-mrtg-data/backbone1.html
</pre></blockquote>
                <p>Links are the network routes between the Nodes. Typically they
                are actual network links, but they can be anything that you can get
                numbers for that make sense on map.</p>

                <p>An absolute minimal link has 3 pieces of information too. They are
                the unique internal name for this link, and unique node names for the
                two endpoints. To show current usage on the map, you'll need to give two
                more pieces: the maximum bandwidth on the link, and a way to get the
                current throughput. The BANDWIDTH is measured in bits/sec, and can
                include the usual K,M,G and T suffixes for large values. The data-source
                is given in the TARGET line, and can be one of

                <ul>
                    <li>MRTG-generated HTML file (which contains a special HTML comment
                    at the bottom with the current values)</li>

                    <li>Cacti-generated RRD file</li>

                    <li>Some other RRD file, provided you know how it is structured
                    internally.</li>
                </ul>

                One important note: the order of the nodes in the NODES line is
                significant. The first node is considered to be the 'local' one when
                thinking about the data source in the TARGET. 'out' will be 'out'
                relative to the first node. If you find the map shows all your data
                flowing in the wrong direction, try swapping the order of the nodes
                here.</p>

                <h3>Global Settings</h3><p>These settings usually live at the top of the
                text file, and specify basic information about the map. The minimum
                settings are:</p>

                <blockquote class = "example">
                    <pre>WIDTH 800
HEIGHT 600</pre></blockquote><p>This is specifies the size of the map in pixels. If you want
                something a bit fancier than a plain white background, you can make up a
                background image to use in PNG format. In that case, the map will be the
                size of the background image:</p>

                <blockquote class = "example">
                    <pre>BACKGROUND western-europe.png</pre>
                </blockquote><p>There are also settings to set which fonts and colours are used
                for various elements of the map, where to position the colour-legend (if
                at all), what files to output, and more advanced layout techniques. The
                full list is in the
                <a href = "config-reference.html">Config Reference</a>.</p>

                <h2 id = "example">A Sample Config</h2>Here's a
                sample configuration, and <a href =
                    "../example/example.html">here's what it produces (modified to work
                a little better)</a>. The data isn't live in the output, but it gives
                you an idea of what can be done. The initial background image is <a href =
                    "../example/background.png">here</a>. The configuration file is also
                in the docs directory of the distribution, should you want it.

                <h3 id = "alternatives">Other
                Weathermaps</h3><p>Obviously, you can't please everyone, so here's a
                list of other weathermap or network visualisation implementations that I
                know of. Some are open source, some aren't. All of them have some subtle
                or interesting wrinkle that the others don't.
                <a href = "mailto:howie@thingy.com">Let me know if you know of any
                others</a>.

                <dl>
                    <dt><a href = "http://netmon.grnet.gr/weathermap/" class = "ext">GRNET
                    perl version</a> by Panagiotis Christias.</dt>

                    <dd>Support only for MRTG, or anything else that can produce similar
                    HTML files.</dd>

                    <dt><a href =
                        "http://wotsit.thingy.com/haj/cacti-weathermap.html">My own perl
                    weathermap</a></dt>

                    <dd>A forked/modified version of the GRNET one above, adds
                    imagemaps, DHTML, RRD-reading and a number of smaller tweaks. No
                    longer updated.</dd>

                    <dd>Another fork of the GRNET perl map. Also with (only?) RRD
                    support, and various graphical enhancements.
                    <i>Also</i> now with a PHP version!</dd>

                        "ext">Indiana University Abilene Weathermap</a></dt>

                    <dd>Another perl (i think) script, but with a rather different map
                    design. Can show error rates on links, too.</dd>

                    <dt><a href =

                        class = "ext">PREGINET Network Weathermap</a></dt>

                    <dd>Another perl open source map. Works by reading MRTG logs, as far
                    as I can tell.</dd>

                    <dt><a href = "http://www.it.teithe.gr/~v13/">V13 netmap</a> (click
                    'netmap' in the left hand panel - I love frames)</dt>

                    <dd>Similar output to this program, but does all it's own SNMP data
                    collection.</dd>
