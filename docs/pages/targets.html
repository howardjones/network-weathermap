 <p>The actual data-reading part of Weathermap is handled by Data Source 
 Plugins since version 0.9. These allow users or third-parties to easily add 
 new data sources into Weathermap without altering the core code. </p> 

 <p>There are a number of plugins supplied as standard, which will be 
 described here. Each one uses a different format of <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> string, which 
 contains the parameters the plugin needs to find your data. 
 <em>All</em> plugins return an 'in' and 'out' value, and some may set other 
 variables that can be accessed by 
 <a href = "advanced.html#tokens">Special Tokens</a> in strings. For 
 situations where there is only really one output, the 'out' value may just 
 be the same as the 'in'. </p> 

 <p>Here are the details of the standard data source plugins: </p> 

 <ul> 
 <li><a href = "#static">Static value</a></li>

 <h3><a id = "static"></a>Static value</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> static:<em>invalue</em>:<em>outvalue</em> 
 </div> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> static:<em>value</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>The simplest of all the plugins, static allows you to just set a value in 
 the config file itself. Sometimes this is useful for testing, or simple maps 
 of things like OSPF metrics. If only a single value is specified, it is used 
 for <em>both</em> input and output, just like the <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_BANDWIDTH">BANDWIDTH</a> parameter. </p> 

 <p>The values in the target string can use the same K,M,G,T suffixes as 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_BANDWIDTH">BANDWIDTH.</a> </p>

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> 
 scale:<em>factor</em>:<em>rrdfile.rrd</em>:<em>in_ds</em>:<em>out_ds</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>This is the 'core' plugin for Weathermap. It reads data from rrd files, 
 created using <a href = "http://www.rrdtool.org/">Tobi Oetiker's RRDtool</a>, 
 by tools like Cacti, MRTG, Cricket, NRG and so on. </p> 

 <p>First of all, Weathermap needs to be able to find your rrdtool 
 executable. If you are using the Cacti plugin, then this information is 
 taken automatically from Cacti. If you are using the command-line tool, you 
 will need to edit 
 <tt>weathermap</tt> around line 29 to point to your rrdtool executable. </p> 

 <h4><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> formats</h4> 

 <p>If you only specify a filename, and no DS-names, the default DS names for 
 RRD files are 'traffic_in' and 'traffic_out', which works with the majority 
 of Cacti RRD files (those produced by the Interface Traffic template). For 
 MRTG-produced RRD files, the names are 'DS0' and 'DS1'. For Cricket 
 standard-interface RRD files, it would be 'ds0' and 'ds1'. 
 </p><p>You can also specify '-' for either DS name, which tells Weathermap 
 to ignore this rrd file for the purposes of the input or output value. This 
 is mainly useful in combination with the aggregation feature, where you can 
 take the input data from one rrd file, and the output data from another. </p> 

 <p>With no prefix, or with just '<b>rrd:</b>' as a prefix, the data read 
 from the rrd file is assumed to be a standard SNMP interface counter, which 
 is a byte-rate. It automatically multiplies these by 8 to get a bit-rate for 
 the map. With the '<b>gauge:</b>' prefix, this multiplication doesn't 
 happen, which is useful for non-bandwidth values, like SNR or 
 session-counts. Finally, you can use the '<b>scale:</b>' prefix to multiply 
 by any factor 
 - suppose you have a value in seconds, and you want to show it in 
 milliseconds for example. Of course, you can also divide using this, by 
 using a scale factor that is less than 1 
 - multiplying by 1/x is the same as dividing by x. Since 0.95, you can also 
 use negative scale factors 
 - useful to turn dB SNR into something weathermap can deal with. </p> 

 <h4>rrdtool adjustments</h4> 

 <p>By default, the plugin will read the last 800 seconds of data, and find 
 the most recent within that to use. You might need to make it read back 
 further, if you are updating your rrd files slowly. You can do this with the 
 <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> command, by adding <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">'SET</a> rrd_period 3000' (any value in seconds) at the 
 top of your map config file, before any <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> or <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINK</a> lines. </p> 

 <p>Similarly, you can change the time that the plugin looks for data at from 
 the present to the past, by using <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">'SET</a> rrd_start -1d' in the top section of 
 the config file. The full range of time-specification strings is at the 
 bottom of the 
 <a href = "http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdfetch.en.html">rrdfetch 
 manual page</a>. </p> 

 <p>If you are using a tool other than Cacti, then the default DS names of 
 traffic_in and traffic_out are probably wrong. You can change the defaults 
 for the whole config file by adding two <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> lines to the top of the map 
 config file. For example, <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">'SET</a> rrd_default_in_ds DS0' and <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">'SET</a> 
 rrd_default_in_ds DS1' will make the default DS names DS0 and DS1 
 respecively so MRTG users don't need to specify the DS names in every <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> 
 line. </p> 

 <p>For any other special rrdtool 'tweaks', you can <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> rrd_options to a 
 string which is added directly to the rrdtool command-line. This should 
 allow for any changes that I haven't expected! </p> 

 <p>Finally, if the <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> filename doesn't begin with a 
 / it is usually assumed to be a relative path from the weathermap directory. 
 If you <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> rrd_default_path to some other path in the global (top) section 
 of the map config file, you can change that assumption so that the DS plugin 
 looks somewhere else. </p> 

 <h4>Cacti-specific additions</h4> 

 <p>If the plugin detects that it is running within the Cacti poller process, 
 it defines a couple of useful global Hint Variables for Cacti users 
 - {map:cacti_path_rra} contains the path to the rra/ directory in your Cacti 
 installation, with no trailing slash, and {map:cacti_url} is the URL to the 
 front page of your Cacti installation, as known to the Plugin Architecture. 
 These can be used in the <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET,</a> <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_INFOURL">INFOURL</a> and <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_OVERLIBGRAPH">OVERLIBGRAPH</a> commands in 
 particular, to reduce a lot of duplication. </p> 

 <h4><a id = "rrdpollerextras">Cacti poller_output support</a> (aka Boost 
 support)</h4> 

 <p>If you are using Cacti as your data collector, and running Weathermap 
 from Cacti's poller, then there is another special feature, called 
 poller_output. Weathermap can intercept data as it is collected by Cacti, 
 and therefore avoid running lots of external rrdtool processes to collect 
 the data it needs to display your map. This is 
 <em>especially</em> useful if you are using TheWitness' Boost plugin, as the 
 data isn't written to the rrd files until some time after it is collected. 
 Even without Boost, it should provide a performance improvement, 
 particularly with large installations of Weathermap. </p> 

 <p>To use this feature, a map-global variable needs to be set. Near the top 
 of your map config file, add <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">'SET</a> rrd_use_poller_output 1'. The setting will 
 take a few poller cycles to take effect: during the first one, the 
 appropriate cacti data sources are identified based on the rrd filenames, on 
 the second cycle values will be collected, and on the third we'll have two 
 values, so any COUNTER datasources will begin to work properly. If the 
 poller_output feature fails to collect data, then the regular 
 rrdtool-running method will be attempted too. </p> 

 <p>Because in poller_output mode, Weathermap is pulling data directly from 
 the Cacti database, it can also collect some other information that you 
 might find useful in your map. It takes all the data stored in the 
 host_snmp_cache table for the specified datasource, and dumps that into Hint 
 Variables. This table contains all the columns that you see when you are 
 picking which datasource to graph in Cacti, so for normal interface traffic, 
 it contains things like the interface speed, operational status, interface 
 description (your 'comment' name, usually) and so on. These are stored in 
 Hint Variables called 'cacti_<em>cache variable</em>' 
 - e.g. cacti_ifSpeed, or cacti_ifIP. It also sets cacti_host_id to be the 
 internal host_id from Cacti for the host containing this data source, and 
 the cacti_graph_id to be the local_graph_id of a graph that uses this DS in 
 Cacti. You can then use those to automatically add correct <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_OVERLIBGRAPH">OVERLIBGRAPH</a> and 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_INFOURL">INFOURL</a> lines: 
 </p> 

 <div class = "example"> 
 <pre> 
 <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> rrd_use_poller_output 1 

 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINK</a> DEFAULT 
 <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> cacti_use_ifspeed 1 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_INFOURL">INFOURL</a> {map:cacti_url}/graph.php?local_graph_id={link:this:cacti_graph_id} 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_OVERLIBGRAPH">OVERLIBGRAPH</a> {map:cacti_url}/graph_image.php?local_graph_id={link:this:cacti_graph_id}&amp;rra_id=0&amp;graph_nolegend=true

 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> {map:cacti_path_rra}/router1_345_traffic_in.rrd 

 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_LINK">LINK</a> uplink2 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_NODES">NODES</a> a c 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> {map:cacti_path_rra}/router1_377_traffic_in.rrd 
</pre> 

 <p>In this example, all each link needs to have defined is the <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> 
 rrdfile, and which nodes it joins. The rest is supplied by this 
 plugin. </p> 
 </div> 

 <p>As an additional sub-feature, if you add <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">'SET</a> cacti_use_ifspeed 1' to either the 
 link or node, or any item it inherits settings from (e.g. DEFAULT) then 
 Weathermap will take the value of ifSpeed (or ifHighSpeed for 4G+ links) and 
 use it in place of the value defined in the map config file 
 - this allows you to do some basic dynamic configuration of Weathermap based 
 on Cacti, which in turn should pick up changes from the network device. </p> 

 <p><strong>Note</strong> that since the rrdtool program is not being run in 
 this mode, you <em>can't</em> use the "time-shifting" features described above 
 - those rely on using 
 <em>real</em> rrdtool files. If you are using poller_output to allow 
 Weathermap to work alongside Boost, then there is no workaround 
 - the data isn't in the .rrd files until Boost's own update process puts it 
 there sometime later. </p> 

 <p><strong>Performance Note:</strong>The additional queries to fill in the 
 interface information from the Cacti database can sometimes add significantly 
 to the runtime for the map. If you know you don't need the information, you 
 can disable those queries, while still using the poller_output support. To do this, 
 add <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">'SET</a> rrd_no_cacti_extras 1' to the top of the map config file. </p> 

 <h4>RRDtool Aggregation</h4> 

 <p>XXX THIS NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN! </p> 

 <hr /> 

 <h3><a id = "tabs"></a>Tab-separated text</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> <em>textfile</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>For tab-delimited data files, the format is plain-text, with three 
 tab-seperated columns. The first one is a linkname, and the second and third 
 are traffic-in and traffic-out, respectively. The linkname should match the 
 name in the configuration file. This allows you to create one text file for 
 the entire map from some outside source. Traffic in &amp; out values can use 
 the same "K,M,G,T" abbreviated forms as the <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_BANDWIDTH">BANDWIDTH</a> configuration command. 
 The file should have an extension of .txt or .tsv to be recognised as a 
 tab-delimited file by Weathermap. </p> 

 <div class = "example"> 
 <h5>A suitable tab-delimited data file</h5> 

<pre>link1 3M 4M 
link2 66K 1.8M 
link3 34.6K 113</pre> 
 </div> 

 <hr /> 

 <h3><a id = "mrtg"></a>MRTG .html file</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> <em>htmlfile</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>This plugin reads data from special comments in the HTML files generated 
 by MRTG. This is intended mainly for people using the 'old-style' MRTG .log 
 files. If you are using MRTG with an RRDtool backend, then it's probably 
 better to use the RRDtool plugin. </p> 

 <p>The file should have an extension of .html or .htm to be recognised as an 
 MRTG file by Weathermap. </p> 

 <p>Since 0.95, there are a few hint variables that will adjust the behaviour 
 of this datasaource: </p> 

 <ul> 
 <li><b><a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> mrtg_swap 1</b> 
 - (per-link/node) will swap the in and out values over</li> 

 <li><b><a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> mrtg_negate 1</b> 
 - (per-link/node) will make negate the value from the MRTG file. 
 Weathermap doesn't deal well with negative values yet, so this is 
 sometimes useful.</li> 

 <li><b><a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> mrtg_period d</b> 
 - (per-link/node) allows you to choose between daily, monthly, weekly, 
 and yearly values - use 'd','m','w','y' - default is 'd'</li> 

 <li><b><a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> mrtg_value av</b> 
 - (per-link/node) allows you to choose between average, minimum, maximum 
 and current values - use 'av','min','max','cu' - default is 'cu'</li> 
 </ul> 

 <hr /> 

 <h3><a id = "cactihost"></a>Cacti host status</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> cactihost:<em>hostid</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>This plugin reads the current status of a host from your Cacti database. 
 The hostid is visible in Cacti URLs when you click on links in the Devices 
 page. The return values for this plugin are numeric codes. It also sets a 
 Hint Variable called 
 <em>state</em> to a string, that can be nicer to use in an <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_ICON">ICON</a> filename, 
 for example 
 - possible values are 'up','down','disabled', and 'recovering'. </p> 

 <table class="bordered striped small"> 
 <thead> 
 <tr><th>Code</th><th><tt>state</tt> value</th> 
 </tr> 
 </thead> 

 <tbody> 
 <tr><td>0</td><td>disabled</td> 
 </tr> 

 <tr><td>1</td><td>down</td> 
 </tr> 

 <tr><td>2</td><td>recovering</td> 
 </tr> 

 <tr><td>3</td><td>up</td> 
 </tr> 

 <tr><td>5</td><td>unknown</td> 
 </tr> 


 </tbody> 
 </table> 

 <p>It also sets the following additional Hint Variables, to use in a <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_LABEL">LABEL,</a> 
 COMMENT or <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_NOTES">NOTES</a> section as you see fit: 
 <em>cacti_hostname</em>, <em>cacti_description</em>, <em>cacti_curtime</em>, 
 <em>cacti_avgtime</em>, <em>cacti_mintime</em>, <em>cacti_maxtime</em>, 
 <em>cacti_availability</em>, <em>cacti_faildate</em>, and 
 <em>cacti_recdate</em> </p>. 

 <p>An appropriate <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SCALE">SCALE</a> definition to get red, green, yellow and grey labels 
 based on the state of a host would be: </p> 

 <div class = "example"> 
<pre><a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SCALE">SCALE</a> cactiupdown 0 0.5 192 192 192 
<a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SCALE">SCALE</a> cactiupdown 0.5 1.5 255 0 0

 <h3><a id = "cactithold"></a>Cacti threshold status</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> cactimonitor:<em>hostid</em> 
 </div> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> cactithold:<em>tholdid</em> 
 </div> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> cactithold:<em>rra_id</em>:<em>data_id</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>When used with cactimonitor: prefix, this plugin takes data from both 
 Cacti's host table and from the THold plugin's data to produce a composite 
 state, similar to the one used by the Monitor plugin. </p> 

 <p>It sets all the same Hint Variables as cactihost: plus a couple more: 
 <em>thold_failcount</em> is the number of thresholds failing on this host, and 
 <em>thold_failpercent</em> is the percentage of thresholds set on this host 
 that are failing. Bear in mind that if you have both a minimum and maximum 
 set on the same variable, then you will <em>never</em> get 100% failure. </p> 

 <p>It also has a new value possible for the <em>state</em> Hint Variable 
 - 'tholdbreached', and adds a new state number 4, for "threshold 
 breached". </p> 

 <p>In the second and third forms, with the cactithold: prefix, the plugin 
 simply returns either a 0 or 1 for the 'input bandwidth' value. 0 if the 
 threshold has not been breached, 1 if it has. You can supply either the 
 internal THold id number for a threshold (not easily visible), or the 
 rra_id and data_id values which can be seen at the end of URLs within THold's 
 web pages. </p> 

 <p>You can provide a similar output to the Monitor plugin by using the 
 cactimonitor: <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> and multiple icons. Create a set of coloured (or 
 otherwise different) icons for your node 
 - they should have 'up','down','disabled','recovering' and 'tholdbreached' 
 in the names. Then: </p> 

 <div class = "example"> 
 <pre><a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> myserver 
<a href="config-reference.html#NODE_LABEL">LABEL</a> Server 1 
<a href="config-reference.html#NODE_POSITION">POSITION</a> 100 100 
<a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> cactimonitor:77 
<a href="config-reference.html#NODE_ICON">ICON</a> images/server_{node:this:state}.png 
<a href="config-reference.html#NODE_LABELOFFSET">LABELOFFSET</a> S 
<a href="config-reference.html#LINK_USESCALE">USESCALE</a> none 
</pre> 
 </div> 
 <p> 
 Will allow you to change the icon between images/server_up.png, 
 images/server_down.png etc.. as the state in Cacti changes and thresholds 
 are breached. The <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_USESCALE">'USESCALE</a> none' on the end stops the label for the node 
 from changing colour as well. </p> 

 <p>You can make use of the <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> aggregation features of weathermap to make 
 a value that is effectively a 'percentage badness' for a set of thresholds. 
 Suppose you have a set of load-balanced firewalls, and you want to see how 
 many of the set have exceeded their session count. You would set up 
 thresholds on each firewall as normal, and then: </p> 

 <div class = "example"> 
 <pre><a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SCALE">SCALE</a> badness 0 100 0 255 0 255 0 0 

<a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> firewall_status 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> cactithold:334:22 cactithold:34:255 cactithold:337:235 cactithold:33:254 
 <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_MAXVALUE">MAXVALUE</a> 4 
 <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_USESCALE">USESCALE</a> badness in 
</pre> 
 </div> 
 <p> 
 defines a scale where 0 is green and 100% is red and in between is a smooth 
 gradient. Each target will return either 0 or 1, so 100% failed thresholds 
 gives a value of 4. Setting the <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_MAXVALUE">MAXVALUE</a> to 4 makes that 100% within 
 weathermap. 
 </p>

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a>

 </div> 

 <p>The 
 <a href = "http://forums.cacti.net/about33875.html">DSStats Cacti plugin</a> 
 stores data as the poller collects it, and also collates periodic average 
 and maximums. Which are all stored in tables in the Cacti database. This 
 makes collecting data (especially the periodic data) much more efficient. 
 This DS plugin will read that data, saving a lot of external calls to 
 <tt>rrdtool</tt>. This is similar to the 'poller_output' mode of the rrdtool 
 DS, except that this way will allow you to easily make monthly or weekly 
 summary maps. On the downside you need to supply the Cacti internal 
 datasource ID for each target, rather than the rrd filename. </p> 

 <p>The <em>dsid</em> parameter is the 'local_data_id' in Cacti 
 - you can see this in the URLs on the datasource management page. The 
 'in_ds' and 'out_ds' are the names of the RRD DS that Cacti will update with 
 these values (e.g. traffic_in and traffic_out for normal Interface Traffic). 
 Either of the in_ds or out_ds can be a single hyphen (-) to indicate that 
 you don't care about filling in a value for that direction. </p> 

 <p>The 
 <em>source</em> parameter defines what data to use for this query. 'last' 
 fetches the most-recently collected value for that dsid. The remaining 
 possibilities all combine a period and a type. The possible periods are 
 'hourly','daily','weekly','monthly' and 'yearly'. The types are 'average' 
 and 'peak'. So to get the maximium value over the last week, use 
 'weeklypeak' as your 
 <em>source</em>. If one is not specified at all (as in the first format 
 above), then 'last' is assumed. You can change that default by setting the 
 global <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> variable "dsstats_default_type" to the required default. </p> 

 <p>The DSStats datasource also sets the same additional variables described 
 in for <a href = "#rrdpollerextras">poller_output support</a> in the rrdtool 
 plugin. </p> 

 <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> One important difference between this and 
 poller_ouput mode or regular rrdtool targets is that this plugin fetches the 
 raw data from the poller. If you collecting octet counter data (like 
 interface traffic) then you will need to multiply that data by 8 to get bits 
 per second: </p> 

 <div class = "example"> 
 <pre><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> 8*dsstats:4455:traffic_in:traffic_out</pre> 
 </div> 

 <p><strong>Performance Note:</strong>As with the rrdtool poller_output support, 
 the additional queries to fill in the 
 interface information from the Cacti database can sometimes add significantly 
 to the runtime for the map. If you know you don't need the information, you 
 can disable those queries, while still using DSStats support. To do this, 
 add <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">'SET</a> dsstats_no_cacti_extras 1' to the top of the map config file. </p>

 <h3><a id = "snmp"></a>SNMP value</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> 
 snmp:<em>community</em>:<em>host</em>:<em>in_oid</em>:<em>out_oid</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>This is a fairly experimental plugin. It requires the PHP snmp extension 
 to be installed and enabled. Even then, it's hit & miss whether it will work 
 on a particular system 
 - some versions of PHP have better support for SNMP than others, and on some 
 platforms it is different to others, too. </p> 

 <p>This plugin can directly query an SNMP-manageable device and fetch an OID 
 from it. You can specify '-' in place of either of the OIDs if you only need 
 to fetch one value. </p> 

 <p>It returns the numeric values for each OID as the in and out values. It 
 <em>does not</em> currently understand COUNTER types, so you will just get 
 the total bytes rather than a rate, for example. </p> 

 <p>It also sets snmp_in_raw and snmp_out_raw to the 'raw' results from the 
 SNMP library, before the plugin tried to force them to be numbers. </p> 

 <p>You can adjust the behaviour of the SNMP plugin with some global <a href="config-reference.html#GLOBAL_SET">SET</a> 
 values. 'snmp_timeout' sets the timeout for a request in 
 <em>microseconds</em> (so the default 1000000=1 second). 'snmp_retries' 
 changes the number of retries per request from the default (2). Finally, you 
 can set 'snmp_abort_count' to an integer value 
 - this is the number of failures for a given host before weathermap gives up 
 on that host. The default is 0 (unlimited). This can improve performance if 
 you are polling a lot of switch ports on a device that has gone down, for 
 example. </p>

 <h3><a id = "script"></a>External script</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> !<em>scriptname</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>This plugin is fairly experimental and not thoroughly tested. Due to the 
 risks involved with using it (it allows someone who can create configs to 
 run arbitrary commands as the user who updates your maps - e.g. the Cacti 
 poller user), it is disabled by default in new installs of version 0.97b and 
 above. To enable it, rename WeatherMapDataSource_external.php.disabled to 
 WeatherMapDataSource_external.php in the lib/datasources directory. Please see 
 the <a href="main.html#security">Security notes</a> elsewhere in this manual before 
 doing that. 
 </p> 

 <p>This plugin allows you to write small external scripts, and pass the 
 value from the script into Weathermap. The output format of the script is 
 the same one that MRTG uses for 
 <em>it's</em> external scripts, so it's possible that you can even find an 
 existing script to do what you want, somewhere else. </p> 

 <p>MRTG external scripts produce 4 lines of output. Line 1 is the state of 
 the first (in) variable, line 2 is the state of the second (out) variable, 
 line 3 is the uptime of the device, and line 4 is the name of the device. 
 This plugin only cares about the first 2 lines, but it 
 <em>does</em> expect there to be 4 lines. </p> 

 <p>This plugin also sets a few Hint Variables 
 - external_line1, external_line2, external_line3, and external_line4 are the 
 raw output of your script. This can be useful if your script really is 
 intended for MRTG, as the 3rd line would be the device uptime and the 4th 
 line would be it's name. </p>

 <h3><a id = "fping"></a>FPING</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> fping:<em>hostname</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>This plugin is fairly experimental and not thoroughly tested. It's also 
 rather slow, as each node takes 5 seconds or so to run. There are planned 
 improvements to take advantage of fping's parallelisation support in a 
 future version. </p> 

 <p>This plugin uses the 'fping' command-line tool 
 [<a href = "http://fping.sourceforge.net/">http://fping.sourceforge.net/</a>] 
 to ping a host, and returns various statistics about it's state. </p> 

 <p>You can adjust the number of pings (the default is 5), by setting the 
 'fping_ping_count' global variable to another number. </p> 

 <p>After it has been run, the 'in' value is the average ping time in 
 milliseconds, the 'out' value is the percentage packet loss from 5 pings (or 
 whatever you have set), the 'fping_min' Hint Variable is the minimum ping 
 time in milliseconds, and 'fping_max' is the maximum. </p> 

 <h3><a id = "time"></a>Current Time</h3> 

 <div class = "definition"><a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> time:<em>zonename</em> 
 </div> 

 <p>This plugin allows you to embed the current time in any timezone in your 
 maps. </p> 

 <p>The 'in' value is the hours, the 'out' value is minutes. </p> 

 <p>The format for specifying timezones is the same as most unix systems 
 - Europe/London, US/Eastern, Japan and Etc/GMT+10 are all valid. These names 
 are usually stored in /usr/share/zoneinfo on a unix-based system. </p> 

 <p>This plugin also sets a few Hint Variables 
 - time_time12, time_time24, time_time12ap. These are the current time in 
 12-hour, 24-hour and 12-hour-with-am/pm, respectively. </p> 

 <p>XXX Add in new offset and time_t related options. Mention %t </p> 

 <p>A typical use is: 
 <code> <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_NODE">NODE</a> timelabel <a href="config-reference.html#NODE_LABEL">LABEL</a> {node:this:time_time12ap} <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_USESCALE">USESCALE</a> none <a href="config-reference.html#LINK_TARGET">TARGET</a> 
 time:Europe/Paris </code> 
 </p> 

 <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>The timezone handling code requires at least PHP 
 version 5. </p>
