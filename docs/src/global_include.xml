    <description xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Include the contents of an additional file within the current map
        configuration file.</p>

        <p>Allows you to use a common set of definition across several map files. There
        are several restrictions:

        <ul>
            <li>INCLUDE can
            <em>only</em> be used in the 'global' section of the the map configuration
            file - that is, before the first NODE or LINK.</li>

            <li>INCULDEd files must contain complete NODE or LINK definitions.</li>

            <li>If you intend to use the web-based editor, then you can't currently use
            any commands other than NODE or LINK definitions
            - that is, no SCALEs or FONTDEFINEs etc.</li>
        </ul>

        The INCLUDE file can still be useful to define a set of standard templates that
        can then be used across maps. Some of the other restrictions will hopefully be
        lifted in a future version. The reason for the restrictions is that the way
        config files are read and written doesn't keep track of where a particular
        setting came from, apart from at the NODE/LINK level. This is also the reason
        why comments are 'lost' by the editor.
