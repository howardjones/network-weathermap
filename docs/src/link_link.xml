        <p>The first line of a LINK definition.</p>

        <p>The linkname must be unique within the map, and must not contain spaces. The
        only place it currently appears is in the small title-bar of a popup graph if
        you specify an OVERLIBGRAPH without an OVERLIBCAPTION, however.</p>

        <p>There is one special link name, 'DEFAULT', which allows for the setting of
        defaults. All links that are defined after this one in the configuration file
        will use the parameters of this link as a starting point. For this reason, it is
        best to define the DEFAULT link at the top of the configuration file, if you
        intend to use it.</p>
