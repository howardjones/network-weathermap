        <p>Creates a popup image in the HTML output.</p>

        <p>If you are using the HTML output facility, and HTMLSTYLE is set to 'overlib',
        then a link is added to the &lt;map> section of the HTML so that when you
        move the mouse pointer over the the (weathermap) link, a box will pop up
        containing the image that you specify. Typically used to link to historical data
        in your network monitoring system.</p>

        <p>You can also specify more than one url, in which case the images are
        'stacked' one after another in the popup box.</p>

        <p>If a NOTES line is also specified for a link, then the image specified here
        appears with the NOTES text underneath it.</p>

        <p>It is also possible to specify the OVERLIBGRAPH for the 'in' and 'out' halves
        of a link individually, using INOVERLIBGRAPH and OUTOVERLIBGRAPH.</p>

        <p>You can influence how Weathermap positions the popup box, using the
        OVERLIBWIDTH and OVERLIBHEIGHT keywords.</p>

        <change version="0.95">Added IN/OUT support

        <change version="0.0pre">Odd fact: This command, and the accompanying code to
        generate overlib imagemaps, were the first modification I ever made to the GRNET
        perl weathermap, and was what got me interested in writing my own version.
