    <description xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>FIXME Specifies where to look for the current throughput
      information for this LINK. Currently this can be done in 5
      ways:

      <ul>
        <li>a path to a cacti-produced RRD file</li>
        <li>a path to a non-cacti-produced RRD file and the DS names within that RRD</li>
        <li>a path to an MRTG-produced HTML "graph holder"
        page.</li>
        <li>a path to a tab-delimited text file</li>
        <li>a URL to an MRTG-produced HTML "graph holder" page.</li>

      </ul>The last of these relies on your PHP installation having
      the "fopen URL extension" enabled. As far I know, it is
      enabled by default on a new install of current PHP version.</p>
      
       <p>The default DS names for RRD files are 'traffic_in' and 'traffic_out', which works with
       the majority of Cacti RRD files. For MRTG-produced RRD files, the names are
       'DS0' and 'DS1'. You can also specify '-' for either DS name, which tells Weathermap to ignore
       this rrd file for the purposes of the input or output value.
       This is mainly useful in combination with the aggregation feature.</p>
       
       <p>For tab-delimited data files, the format is plain-text, with three tab-seperated columns.
       The first one is a linkname, and the second and third are traffic-in and traffic-out, respectively.
       The linkname should match the name in the configuration file. This allows you to create one text file
       for the entire map from some outside source. Traffic in &amp; out values can use the same "K,M,G,T" abbreviated forms
       as the BANDWIDTH configuration command. The file should have an extension of .txt or .tsv to be
       recognised as a tab-delimited file by Weathermap.</p>

<p>You can also specify multiple targets, which will then be added together to make the aggregate bandwidth
which is then displayed. Specify the targets on one TARGET line, seperated with a space.</p>
