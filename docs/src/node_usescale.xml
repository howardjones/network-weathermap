        <p>Specify which SCALE to use to decide the colour of this node.</p>

        <p>After the percentage usage is calculated (using BANDWIDTH/MAXVALUE and data
        from the TARGET line), the colour is decided by looking up the percentage
        against this SCALE. If there is no USESCALE line, then the default scale is
        used.</p>

        <p>If you also specify 'absolute', then no percentage calculation is performed.
        The raw values from the TARGET line are just looked up in the named SCALE.</p>

        <p>For nodes, you can also specify a scalename of 'none'. This stops the node's
        colour from changing at all. This is useful if you want to use the TARGET line
        to fetch data that is used in the LABEL or ICON of the node, for example,
        without changing the colour of the node itself.</p>

        <p>You can also change the colour of the ICON associated with a NODE according
        to a different SCALE, by using USEICONSCALE.</p>
