<div id="nojs" class="alert"><b>WARNING</b> - Sorry, it's partly laziness on my part, but you really need JavaScript
    enabled and DOM support in your browser to use this editor. It's a visual tool, so accessibility is already an
    issue, if it is, and from a security viewpoint, you're already running my code on your <i>server</i> so either you
    trust it all having read it, or you're already screwed.<P>If it's a major issue for you, please feel free to
        complain. It's mainly laziness as I said, and there could be a fallback (not so smooth) mode for non-javascript
        browsers if it was seen to be worthwhile (I would take a bit of convincing, because I don't see a benefit,
        personally).</div>

                editor is not finished! There are many features of Weathermap that you will be missing out on if you
                choose to use the editor only.These include: curves, node offsets, font definitions, colour changing,
                per-node/per-link settings and image uploading. You CAN use the editor without damaging these features
                if you added them by hand, however.
