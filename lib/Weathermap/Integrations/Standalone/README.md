# Standalone Integration

Currently a placeholder.

This will contain the ApplicationInterface and other UI stuff related to the 
'standalone' weathermap app. It's intended to have a simple 
web app with its own authentication, database and poller process, so that users outside
of a supported NMS can still use similar features.

It'll also act as a reference for implementing new integrations.
