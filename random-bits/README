suite-1.conf
suite-2.conf
============
These are my test map config files that exercise a fair bit of the
functionality of Weathermap, in a couple of files. The first one
is mostly NODE stuff, and the second is mostly LINK stuff. As such,
they make quite useful demo maps, I guess. suite-1.png and suite-2.png
show what these maps *should* look like. They use quite a few fonts
that I can't supply, but mostly they use Bitstream Vera, which is in
the docs/example directory.

map-split.php
=============

Reads in a map, then writes out 'submaps' of a certain size. Edit the
top of the script to specify the source map, and the required size of
the new maps, and it will chop up your map for you. It doesn't do 
anything clever with things like KEYPOS or TITLEPOS, but it will do
NODEs OK. It'll delete any links where only one end is in the final
map, so cross-sheet links will need to be put back in. It also removes
the BACKGROUND image if there is one, since it will (by definition) be
the wrong size for the new maps.

auto-overlib.pl
===============

A small but useful script that takes a weathermap config file with 
references to Cacti RRD targets and automatically adds in all the 
INFOURL and OVERLIBGRAPH lines it can, where they don't exist. 

You'll need to edit the script to allow it to log in to your Cacti 
database. Requires the Perl DBI and DBD::mysql modules. 

Should work with both PHP and perl versions, but not tested with PHP 
one. 

cacti-integrate.php
===================

A script that reads in a weathermap config file, looks for special SET
variables and uses them to populate as much as it can of TARGET, INFOURL,
OVERLIBGRAPH, and BANDWIDTH. Requires a correct editor-config.php to access
the Cacti database.

You need SET one of 'cacti_id', 'hostname' or 'address' in each NODE so that
it can find the Cacti Host ID for each node.

You need to SET one of 'in_interface' or 'out_interface' to the interface name
so that it can figure out which data sources are relevant. The interface name should
match one of ifAlias, ifName or ifDescr from your router.

cacti-mapper.php
================

A script that reads interface IPs from Cacti, and then uses Cacti's SNMP data
to fetch a netmask for each interface. It then uses all this info to work out
which interfaces are in the same address range as each other, and produces a
map. The map positions are random, but the connections should be right. You need
to run the results through cacti-integrate.php, to fill in the TARGET lines.
Requires a correct editor-config.php to access the Cacti database.

bristle.php
============

Generates a section of Weathermap config useful for showing traffic for all switch 
ports in a small space. Intended to work with cacti-integrate.php
