    <description xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Specifies the maximum throughput of this link, in bits per second.</p>

        <p>This is used to calculate the percentage utilisation, which in turn is used
        to make the colour for the link arrow, and optionally the label on the link.</p>

        <p>The second form allows you to have 'asymmetric' links, like an ADSL, where
        the first number is the maximum bandwidth from node1 to node2 and the second is
        the maximum from node2 to node1, as they are given in the NODES line.</p>

        <p>Bandwidths can also use K,M,G and T suffixes to specify large values. Also
        see the KILO global option though.</p>

    <changes>
        <change version="0.9">Added MAXVALUE as a synonym to match NODE MAXVALUE. No
        change in functionality.
        </change>

        <change version="0.5">Added support for decimals in BANDWIDTH specifications.
        </change>

        <change version="0.4">Added support for K,M,G,T suffixes on bandwidth specs.
        Changed bandwidth from bytes to bits.
